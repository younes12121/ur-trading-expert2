## ⏰ While Waiting for Mercury Response (1-3 days)

### 1. Prepare Your Documents (Do This Now)
Make sure you have all documents ready in PDF format:

- [ ] **EIN Confirmation Letter** (PDF)
- [ ] **LLC Articles of Organization** (PDF)
- [ ] **Operating Agreement** (PDF)
- [ ] **Passport** (scanned PDF or photo)
- [ ] **Proof of Address** (bank statement or utility bill - last 90 days)
- [ ] **Business Revenue Explanation** (the document we created earlier)

**Why:** You'll need these for backup banks anyway, so prepare them now.

### 2. Research Backup Banks

**Option A: Traditional Banks (Require In-Person Visit)**
- **Bank of America** - Best for Stripe integration
- **Chase Business Banking** - Good online tools
- **Wells Fargo** - Established business banking

**Option B: Online Banks (No In-Person Required)**
- **Relay Financial** - Online, international-friendly
- **Wise Business Account** - Works for international businesses
- **Novo** - Online business banking

**Note:** Traditional banks have higher approval rates but require US travel. Online banks are easier but may have similar restrictions.

### 3. Check Your Website Status
- [ ] Make sure your website is live at `https://urtradingexpert.com`
- [ ] Test all links work
- [ ] Ensure it looks professional

**Why:** Banks often check your website as part of verification.
