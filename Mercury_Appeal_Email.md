Our business is a legitimate subscription-based trading signals service (Financial Services industry) that will process payments via Stripe. We have all required LLC documentation, EIN, and business verification materials.

Is there any additional information or documentation I can provide that would allow you to reconsider the application?

Thank you for your assistance.
